Next plan: In this attempt, I was unsuccessful. I accidentally bought a product that was $100, which is more than my budget of $30. Either way, the initial search results were not good. Next time, I will do search["variety pack of chips"] and then check if the results meet the dairy free and the $30 budget constraints. I will continue to refine my searches so that I can find more products.

Next plan: In this attempt, I was unsuccessful. The initial search results were not the products that I was looking for. Next time, I will do search["vegetarian bacon"] for a broader search. I will check that the new results will fulfill the gluten free and 4 ounce pack of 2 constraints. I will continue to refine my searches so that I can find more products.
