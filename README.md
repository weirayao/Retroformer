## üëã Overview <a name="overview"></a>
This paper introduces a principled framework for reinforcing large language agents by learning a retrospective model, which automatically tunes the language agent prompts from environment feedback through policy gradient. Specifically, our proposed agent architecture learns from rewards across multiple environments and tasks, for fine-tuning a pre-trained language model which refines the language agent prompt by summarizing the root cause of prior failed attempts and proposing action plans. Experimental results on various tasks demonstrate that the language agents improve over time and that our approach considerably outperforms baselines that do not properly leverage gradients from the environment.

### ‚ú® Framework <a name="aci"></a>
Retroformer is comprised of two language model components: an **actor** LLM, denoted, which generates reasoning thoughts and actions, and a **retrospective** LLM, which generates verbal reinforcement cues to assist the actor in self-improvement by refining the actor prompt with reflection responses. 

The actor model is regarded as an frozen LLM, such as GPT, with inaccessible model parameters. In this scenario, the most direct approach to enhancing actor performance in a given environment is by refining the actor LM's prompt. Consequently, the retrospective model, a smaller local language model, refines the actor's prompt by incorporating a concise summary of errors and valuable insights from failed attempts. We therefore aim to optimize the retrospective model using environment reward. The desired behavior of $M_r$ is to improve the actor model $M_a$ in next attempt. Hence, the difference in episode returns between two consecutive trials naturally serves as a reward signal for fine-tuning the retrospective model with reinforcement learning.
